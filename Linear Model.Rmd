```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tigerstats)
library(tidyverse)
data <- read.csv(file="https://onlinestatbook.com/case_studies_rvls/physical_strength/data.txt",sep="",header=TRUE) 
```


# Goal

Read about the data from the website where it is staged.  Then form three regression models; Model1 is SIMS~ARM, Model2 is SIMS~GRIP, and Model3 is SIMS~ARM+GRIP. For each model find a 95% prediction interval of SIMS given a value of 94  for GRIP and 88 for ARM. Compare Model1 with Model3 using anova. Write it up in a markdown document, push the project up to your github account and submit it back to canvas as link. 

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


##Now with ggplot - first select the basic data
  
```{r}
basicNN <- ggplot(data,aes(y=SIMS,x=ARM))
```
##Now add in scatterplot

```{r}
basicNN + geom_point()
```

###get fancy  
  
```{r}
basicNN + geom_point(aes(SIMS=ARM)) 
```

Our y-axis is called SIMS and our x-axis is called ARMS. From looking at this scatter plot, there is a positive linear regression occurring between ARM and SIMS.

  
# Numerical results

  
```{r}
cor(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
```

Our numerical result is a positive number at 0.6860073 which means the linear regression will be postive and move from  left to right.

# Inferential  (Build linear model)
  
  
```{r}
model.1 <- lm(SIMS~ARM,data=data)
summary.lm(model.1)
```

In this linear regression model, the numbers that should be considered to create a prediction equations are the estimate coefficients. To predict SIMS based on ARM strength, the intercept, 4.1 would be added to 0.5, ARM and then multiplied by ARM. The formula needed is y = mx + b to create a line. The bigger the adjusted R-squared the better model. 

In the adjusted R Square, the error was reduced by 46%(0.467). The adjusted R Square represents the reduction of the error from the mean model on a percentage basis.

The 145 degrees of freedom is how many data points are displayed in the plot. The line is to be estimate where it hits the y-axis. Each data will change the degree of freedom. Every time you add more stuff to the model, multiple R-squared will down a small percentage 

# now add the model fit to our plot

  
```{r}
basicNN + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm)
``` 

The standard error was 1.226 of each point along the ARM axis, the means of the distribution is where the line falls. The spread of the dots of the standard deviation of that normal distribution. Each pt of the line is a representative of one of the output.

Every point displayed in the plot is an error. We must take the distance between each one of those points and square it. The sum of all errors squared is the average mean error.
The equation formula for a line is y = mx + b

```{r}
newdata = data.frame(GRIP= 94, ARM = 88)
predict(model.1, newdata, interval = "confidence")
```
